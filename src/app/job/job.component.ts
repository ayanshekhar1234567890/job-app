With this technology at its heart, the company is reimagining connectivity for the under-connected and unconnected globally, in order to make the internet accessible, affordable and reliable for the masses, whilst being economically viable for the internet ecosystem.\n\nOver the next 2 years, our goal is to transform the travel experience for 300 mn commuters monthly, unlocking over 2.5 billion hrs of digital consumption, where otherwise Apps don’t work reliably, due to unstable or inexistent cellular connectivity.\n\nHow do we do it?\n\nWe install servers at key places of interest (POIs) where users access internet services (Public transport, Rural areas, Residential complexes, Corporate parks, Hotels, Educational institutes, Retail zones, F&B outlets, etc.) Sugar Box’s patented technology then uses prediction algorithms to cache relevant data from partner Apps on each local server. In addition to this, the local server uses Edge computing to manage other technical requirements such as User registration, Personalization, Security, Ads & Payments. This server is then exposed to the consumer over a local Wi-Fi so that s/he is able to use the partner Apps without any dependence on internet connectivity.\n\nWhat disruption are we creating?\n\nThe Next Billion Users globally will be able to start using Digital Services without purchasing an internet connection!\n\nUnlock seamless digital access on-the-go, in villages & remote areas, where users are in a near captive environment (And courtesy of the lockdown, we have all experienced what being held captive does to digital consumption!)\n\nEven offline consumption can now be monetized – that means consumer will be served Ads & will be able to transact even without connectivity.\n\nAt ubiquitous scale, Sugar Box will make the internet 200% faster and 50% cheaper\n\nJob Description\n\nRole – Manager / Senior Manager – Strategy & Growth\n\nRole Summary\n\nThis is a key role that cuts across several company domains. The responsibilities would revolve around evaluating strategic initiatives/projects, conducting market research and due diligence, formulating business plans & conducting feasibility analysis, and developing an in-house knowledge center across digital and network ecosystems among others. The role involves mobilizing efforts to fast-track closures across functions.
